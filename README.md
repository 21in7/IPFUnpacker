# IPFUnpacker
 - Usage : ipf_unpack.exe \<IPF file\> [encrypt/decrypt]
 
Careful ! This tool will **replace** the encrypted IPF with the decrypted one.  
Make sure to backup your IPF files somewhere before decrypting them.  
Once decrypted, the IPF is readable by traditional tools (such as IPF Suite).

# IPFUnpacker
 - Usage : ipf_unpack.exe \<IPF file\> [encrypt/decrypt]
 
#### README

- Be careful, this tool will **replace** the encrypted IPF with the decrypted one. Please make sure to backup your IPF files before decrypting them.  

- Before decrypting the IPF, please make sure your IPF isn't opened in IPF Suite, and close the game (no Client_tos.exe process in the background).

- If it doesn't appear to work correctly, check if you're opening the correct IPF in IPF Suite. It happened to me multiple times to mix up the IPFs thinking I was in the correct folder :blush:.



Once decrypted, the IPF is readable by traditional tools (such as IPF Suite).
